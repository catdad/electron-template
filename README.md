# âš› electron template

## Why wold you do this?

Well... it's mostly because I couldn't find a started project that I actually wanted to use. The templates and boilerplates and starter apps all seemed to fit into two categories:
* Following the tends: "Say, you like React and Redux and Webpack? I have an Electron starter script for you."
* Bare bones: Handle the minimum amount of code necessary to create a basic Electron app, then leave the user to their own devices.

In both of these cases, the user is barely ready to actually create an app once they have started. They can even create more problems than they solve. So instead, I started down the route and creating Electron applications from scratch. Several applications in, and I am finding that I need to copy paste some code every time I start a new one. That is this code. Let's explore it.

## Code Build

Right off the bat... there isn't one. And it's a good thing. I'm not going to go into the history of why I hate builds here, but I will just posit taht you don't need one. Electron is the most cutting-edge browser with every latest feature combines with the most recent NodeJS runtime, all rolled into a single environment. If there is something you actually need, it is already there.
